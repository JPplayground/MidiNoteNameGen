# MidiNoteNameGen

A simple tool that accepts an nka file (drum mapping preset for the GGD Kits) and 
produces a Midi Note Name file (a txt file that Reaper uses to show custom names within the piano roll). Currently works for:
- Invasion
- The PIV Matt Halpern Kit
- The Original Matt Halpern Signature Pack
- OKW Metal
- OKW Aggressive Rock
- OKW Architects  
These are the kits that I own currently and plan on acquiring more in the future.

# Presets
If you don't want to mess with the tool I have included some mappings and corresponding reaper midi note name files that you can download:

These contain the default mappings the come with these kits (which is kinda wierd) and a more optimized version where kit sections are grouped nicely.
