# MidiNoteNameGen

[Download the tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pattersonjosh15/MidiNoteNameGen/main/download/MidiNoteNameGen.exe)

A simple tool that accepts an nka file (drum mapping preset for the GGD Kits) and 
produces a Midi Note Name file (a txt file that Reaper uses to show custom names within the piano roll). Currently works for:
- Invasion
- The PIV Matt Halpern Kit
- The Original Matt Halpern Signature Pack
- OKW Metal
- OKW Aggressive Rock
- OKW Architects

These are the kits that I own currently and I do plan on acquiring more in the future.  However if you would like to see functionality for kits not listed here read the "How To Help" section (no money involved :D )

# Presets

If you don't want to mess with the tool I have included some mappings and corresponding reaper midi note name files that you can download:

These presets contain the default mappings that come with these kits (which are a bit wierd in my opinion) and a more optimized version where kit sections are grouped nicely.
